PHPWLANstat
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
PHPWLANstat is a software which is looking for
WLAN accesspoints in the background. It writes
all founded accesspoints in a SQLite database
file specified in config.inc.php. The sense of
this program: After using it long time you can
generate statistics about protected and
unprotected accesspoints in your city. Maybe
I will write a tool for graphical statistics later
